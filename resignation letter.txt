Dear sir,
  As discussed with you please accept this letter of resignation from the position of QA Engineer, effective from Today and my last working day will be 16/Jun/2022.
I have accepted a position with another company that will do further for growth and development in my career. I have really enjoyed working here and will miss my colleagues. However, this new position will challenge my growth and further my career.

During the notice period, I am willing to help you in any way to make the transition as smooth as possible. This includes assisting in recruiting and training my replacement. Please let me know if there is anything specific that you would like me to do.
Again, it has been a pleasure working as a part of your company.

Sincerely,
Reshma Pandurang Kakade
